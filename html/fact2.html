<p id="factContent"> Rather than a skeleton made up of bones, jellyfish have bells containing fluid and circular muscles. <br> If they want to move, jellyfish can propel themselves along by contracting their muscles and squirting water in the opposite direction from where they want to go.<br> Or to save themselves the effort of doing this, jellyfish can also simply drift along with the oceanâ€™s currents.</p>
